# 🌍 PIXELNATION

## The World's First Decentralized Territory Conquest Game on Solana

---

## 🎯 What is PIXELNATION?

PIXELNATION is a **real-time multiplayer strategy game** where players form alliances and compete to dominate the world map, one pixel at a time.

Think **Risk meets Reddit Place** — but on the blockchain, with real stakes and real rewards.

---

## 💡 The Vision

In a world of fleeting meme coins, PIXELNATION offers something different: **a game with actual utility**.

Your $PXN tokens aren't just for speculation — they're your **ticket to the battlefield**. Hold tokens, join an alliance, and fight for global domination on a shared, persistent world map.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Connect Your Wallet
Link your Solana wallet to enter the arena.

### 2️⃣ Buy $PXN
You need at least 1 $PXN token to play.

### 3️⃣ Join or Create an Alliance
- **Join** an existing alliance and adopt their color
- **Create** your own alliance (requires 1%+ token supply)
- Each alliance has a unique color — no two alliances share the same

### 4️⃣ Conquer Territory
Click on the world map to paint pixels in your alliance's color. Every pixel you paint:
- Counts toward your alliance's score
- Shows up instantly for all players worldwide
- Stays on the map until someone else paints over it

### 5️⃣ Dominate the Leaderboard
The alliance with the most pixels rules the leaderboard. Weekly rewards go to the top performers.
